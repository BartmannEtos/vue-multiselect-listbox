## SCSS Variables

SCSS variables are used in most of the component styles. You can check the complete styling in `src/scss`. The variables listed below can be found at
[`src/scss/_variables`](https://github.com/abhimediratta/vue-multiselect-listbox/blob/master/src/scss/_variables.scss).

<<< @/../src/scss/_variables.scss


All variables are implemented with `!default` in order to make them easier to override in your application.
